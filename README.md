# Overview

This Project provides the tools and configuration to perform the testing of any kind of block storage.

The project provides feature to visualize the performance of storage in a graphical way. The user would be able to run the performance test in a controlled way.

The project provide the ability to test the storage on Openstack, K8s and vmware as well.

The project relies on well known load generator tool called FIO.
### Goals

- To test block storage
- Provide UI for VMs provisioning on Openstack
- Attach storage with the provisioned VM
- Provide UI to customize I/O workloads
- Provide UI to start the run and monitor its status
- Start the FIO test as per the customer's inputs
- Analysis of storage performance metrics
- Display performance graphs for the run in GUI
- Download the graphs as a PPT

### Non Goal

- Provisioning of Storage cluster deployment
- Stress testing of CPU and RAM

### Basic architecture overview
TBU

### How to run the test

- Prepare test machine
- Prepare target machine and attach storage disks
- Clone the code from GitHub on test machine
- Install boost on test machine
- Open GUI on test machine
- In GUI, go to Jobs and start `new Job`
- Input all required parameters for the test
- Start the test run and wait for its completion
- Click the the `graphs` to check the results
- To download the graphs, use 'download graphs' button. PPT file will be downloaded.

### How to Test Openstack

### Boost motivation:

- Testing storage is very complex and time taking task
- Existing I/O benchmark/test tools out there arenâ€™t flexible enough to do what we wanted.

### Future Scope

- To do the resource cleanups
- Provide UI for VMs provisioning on Kubernetes and Vmware
- Benchmark testing by comparing test results for two test run
- To show the performance deviation for two test runs
- To integrate the tool as acceptance test with Open Source tool called Sylva (https://gitlab.com/sylva-projects/sylva)
- To provide support for testing of object storage
